This has everything I always wanted to do:

Have my own library that doesn't exist yet and might be helpful in certain use cases.
Publish it to maven-central.
Be a lifetime maintainer.
Do and manage releases.
This will give me independence!

Delve into JDK's code to understand any cache line performance tricks and others, that gives me an opportunity to learn.


Really I'm sure it happens a lot in the world where people just look up if X exists and if it does they simply go ahead and use it.
